**Author**: Lacy Hogan and Matt Harding
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
Some HTML and CSS stuff. I can't remember, so I am filling this space with text instead of leaving it blank.

## Getting Started
Stare blankly at the screen for, like, an hour, and try to remember what all the words mean. Then hope your lab partner can figure it out and try to understand what they're doing.

## Architecture
HTML5, CSS

## Change Log
03-21-18 2:20pm - I can't remember, because I didn't make it at the time, because I didn't know to do this yet.

## Credits and Collaborations
Probably Shannon Dillon and Nicholas Carignan
